## Day 1

- Revised the basic syntax of Java
- Revised data types in Java
- Revised functions, function parameters, pass by value nature of Java and scopes
- Learnt about Arrays
- Learnt about ArrayLists:
      <p> - If you don't know how many elements you are going to input inside your array, you can discard the array data structure and use arrayList. It's like saying to Java, "Hey java i don't know how many 
            elements, I am going to insert, so handle the size of the data structure for me.</p> 

### - Solved a problem where you have to swap 2 elements inside an array
### - Solved a problem where you have to find max value in an array

- Learnt about linear search
        <p>It's linear in nature</p>
        <p>Time complexity is o(n)</p>
        <p>Best case is constant and best case time complexity is o(1)</p>

### -  Coded Linear search
### - Solved a problem where you have to use linear search to find a specific character is present in a String.

## Solved twoSum leetcode problem

# Day 2

- Learnt about linear search in 2D Array
### Solved a leetcode problem where you have to find the even number of digits in an array
### Solved a leetcode problem where you have to find the maximum wealth of a person (2D array)
- Learnt about binary Search
      <p> - Binary search is simply a more optimised way to search in an array.</p>
      <p> - But it only works with sorted arrays.</p>
      <p> - The worst case time complexity of a binary search algorithm is o(log N) which makes it more efficient than using linear search algorithm.</p>
- Solved 2 problems in binary search namely finding the ceil and floor of a target element
